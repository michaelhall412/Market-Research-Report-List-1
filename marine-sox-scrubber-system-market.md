<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine SOx Scrubber System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Closed Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Hybrid Scrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Marine SOx Scrubber System market comprises three main types: Open Loop Scrubbers, Closed Loop Scrubbers, and Hybrid Scrubbers. Open Loop Scrubbers use seawater for washing exhaust gases, discharging treated water back into the sea. Closed Loop Scrubbers, on the other hand, use a recirculating freshwater solution and neutralizing agents, generating minimal discharge. Hybrid Scrubbers provide flexibility, allowing operation in both open and closed loop modes, adapting to regulatory requirements and environmental conditions for effective sulfur emission control.</p></p>
