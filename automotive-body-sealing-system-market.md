<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Body Sealing System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>EPDM</li><li>TPE</li><li>PVC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive body sealing system market comprises three primary types: EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer), TPE (Thermoplastic Elastomer), and PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride). EPDM is known for its excellent resistance to weathering and UV exposure, making it ideal for exterior seals. TPE offers a balance of flexibility and recyclability, suitable for various sealing applications. PVC, often used for its cost-effectiveness and durability, is employed in sealing components but has limitations in flexibility compared to EPDM and TPE. Together, these materials enhance vehicle integrity and longevity.</p></p>
