<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The X-Ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect</li><li>Direct</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The X-Ray Flat Panel Detector market is categorized into two main types: indirect and direct detectors. Indirect detectors utilize a scintillator to convert X-ray photons into visible light, which is then detected by a photodetector, making them cost-effective yet less sensitive. In contrast, direct detectors convert X-ray photons directly into an electric signal, offering better image quality and higher sensitivity. Each type serves varied applications in medical imaging, industrial inspection, and security, catering to specific user needs and technological advancements.</p></p>
